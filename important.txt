Slow passage through resonance

The setup is similar to the familiar slow passage through a Hopf
bifurcation problem, where for slow variations of the control parameter,
oscillations are delayed until the parameter has exceeded the critical value
of the static-parameter problem by an amount that is the difference between
the Hopf value and the initial value of the parameter
