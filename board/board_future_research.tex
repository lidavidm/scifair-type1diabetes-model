In this analysis, the level of beta cells varies linearly, but in reality,
beta cells regenerate. Thus, extending the system with a model of beta cell
regeneration would make it more biologically accurate. For instance, models
of type 2 diabetes often account for this and could serve as a starting
point for research [Dr.\ Jiaxu Li, University of Louisville, personal
  communication, December 6, 2013]. Additionally, conducting further
experiments in mice to obtain more data on the oscillations would help
fine-tuning the model; note both the large error bars in the original data
(see introduction) and the parameter sensitivity of this model
\cite{Mahaffy2007}.
