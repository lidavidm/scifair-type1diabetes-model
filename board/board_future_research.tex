In this analysis, the level of beta cells linearly and monotonically varies,
but beta cells regenerate; accounting for this would make the model more
biologically accurate. Models of type 2 diabetes often consider this and
could serve as a starting point for research [Dr.\ Jiaxu Li, University of
  Louisville, personal communication, December 6, 2013]. Additionally,
conducting further experiments in mice to obtain more data on the
oscillations would help fine-tune the model; note both the large error bars
in the original data (see introduction) and the parameter sensitivity of
this model \cite{Mahaffy2007}. Finally, the WKB method could be applied to
approximate when exactly the oscillations begin [Dr.\ Stephen Baer, Arizona
  State University, personal communication, January 3, 2014].
